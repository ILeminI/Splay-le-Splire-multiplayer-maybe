# Splay-le-Splire-multiplayer-maybe
I attempt to make a game in the style of "Slay the Spire" but multiplayer. This may or may not work, idc it will be fun to make...

Ideas:
1. Hearthstone Battle ground type beat:
  . 4-8 players in a loby and 1 winner
  . Build deck in the beginning/after fights
  . Each loss results in some kind of progress twards elimination like some health going down or something
  . fight sum bots sometimes
  . Relics as rewards sometimes?
  . Shop man?!
  
2. Classic deck builder 
  . 1v1 opponents with rank
  . Get cards as reward somehow
  . Relics at some point
  
ISSUE!!!!
Slay the spire is good partly because you know what the enemy monsters gona do, like attack for 45 or debuf or buff. If there were no prediction thingy, you would just be playing in the blind, and just shield randomly + attack randomly.
  . You can see enemy cards?
  . One player plays, the other one plays, then the actions carry out at the same time? (Player 1 plays attack 5 and defend 2, Player 2 plays Attack 10 defend 1, then on screen both plays shield and attack each other simultaniously)
  . Real time??!!!??!!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?? (Shielding lasts 5 seconds perhaps, play a card and it has a small cooldown until activating like in clash royale)
